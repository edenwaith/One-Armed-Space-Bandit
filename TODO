- Instructions Sceen
	- The Story So Far screen
	- How to use/Directions (raise, lower bet, how to spin)
	- Betting odds (diamonds, eyes, cherries, skulls)

		- Get these image assets and create B&W versions
	+ Fix the sound balance of the "lost spin" sound.  Or lower the other sounds.
	- Do not allow multiple sounds to play at the same time (win sound and then trying to spin again).
	
- End Scene
	+ Make larger font.
	/ Add graphics, animations, etc.
	- Why isn't the music stopping when leaving the screen?
	
- Title Scene
	- Display version number (if this just remains a big bucket of hurt, skip it)
	
- Credits Scene
	- Scroll text
	- Squash the credits and play march 

- General 
	- Once the game is nearly complete, remove any unnecessary files, libraries, etc. to keep the game as small as possible.
	- Restore game state when returning (be able to continue game, returning to the Main Menu might be fine.)

- Bugs
	- When jumping from the Game to End scene after winning, multiple sounds can be playing.
	- Avoid other cases where multiple sounds can be playing.
