TODO:

+ Instructions Sceen
	+ The Story So Far screen
	+ How to use/Directions (raise, lower bet, how to spin)
	+ Betting odds (diamonds, eyes, cherries, skulls)
	
- Game Scene
	+ Finish flushing out the background graphics
	+ Animations after a win
	- Display the laser and shoot the player (with sound)
		- Get these image assets and create B&W versions
	+ Fix the sound balance of the "lost spin" sound.  Or lower the other sounds.
	+ Do not allow multiple sounds to play at the same time (win sound and then trying to spin again).
	
+ End Scene
	+ Make larger font.
	+ Add graphics, animations, etc. 
		+ Still need the broke animation
	+ Why isn't the music stopping when leaving the screen? (calling the method was calling from another file)
	+ Finalize the text for all three types of endings (Won, Broke, Death)
	
- Title Scene
	- Display version number (if this just remains a big bucket of hurt, skip it)
	
- Credits Scene
	/ Finish adding any other credits, beta testers, joke names/text, etc.
	+ Scroll text
	+ Find a suitable version of the Liberty Bell March (MIDI version)
	+ Make proper version of the Splat sound
	+ Play the Liberty Bell March
	+ Finish designing the foot
	+ Squash the credits 
	/ Add a QR Code and/or URL at the end?
	- Add a dedication and dithered image of Precious at the bottom.  Probably will need to increase the length of the song.
	- Thanks (Panic, podcasts, Uncrank'd zine, PD community)

- General 
	+ Add Sierra AGI font for the title
	+ Be able to increase the size of the title (text are treated as images)
	- Once the game is nearly complete, remove any unnecessary files, libraries, etc. to keep the game as small as possible.
	+ Restore game state when returning (be able to continue game, returning to the Main Menu might be fine.)
	/ Normalize sound effects across the entire game.  A lot of the MIDIs, in particular, are quite loud.  WAV files tend to be softer.
		- Bump up the volume of the Liberty Bell March (20% or so).
	- Create wrapping paper design
	- When the Home menu is displayed and have the custom screen, perhaps show the controls like what Icy Dungeon displays?

- Bugs
	+ When jumping from the Game to End scene after winning, multiple sounds can be playing.
	+ Avoid other cases where multiple sounds can be playing.
	+ The death music seems to pause for a brief moment after it first starts.  I noticed that the synthVolume is getting set twice, one of those being right at when the song seems to hiccup. (Solution: playDeathSong() was called in two places!)
	- When starting up the game, the title screen flashes briefly
	+ After the "lost spin" sound, the controls aren't active for about another partial second.  Is the MP3 longer or just take a bit to call the callback function?  The MIDI sounds seem more immediate.
	+ The You Lost sound has a bit of empty space before it plays, perhaps trim some of that off, as well.
	+ Bump up the sound of the You Lost sound (sound27.mp3) a bit.  20% perhaps?  Ended up bumping twice by about 10dB.
	/ After losing all of your money, play the final "lost" sound, then move to the end scene.

	- Is it possible to enter a Konami-type code to cheat?
	- More sounds, such as when pulling the crank or changing the bet amount?
